## Prep Work

### Object Methods: `this`

* [What is Object Oriented Programming? (1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlLuL3jYLvA)
* [What is Object Oriented Programming? (2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXnnw9rQH5I)
* [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/object-methods)

### Sunday Lesson Plan

Study the [Sunday lesson plan](https://hackyourfuture.be/encapsulation/week-1) so you come prepared. It's not possible to learn everything in 4 hours, the more prepared you are the more you will benefit from class!

## Lesson Plan

* [Slide show is right here](https://hackyourfuture.be/encapsulation/week-1) - Be sure to look over the slides before coming in on Sunday!

## Assignments

Starting with the exercises will make it easier to complete the project.  Spending a few days practicing before diving into the project will be worth it.

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* Fork [functions-to-methods](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/functions-to-methods)
  * solve each one on a separate branch and merge to master when they are complete
* Fork [numbery-organizer](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/numbery-organizer)
  * solve each one on a separate branch and merge to master when they are complete
* Fork [getters-and-setters](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/getters-and-setters)
  * solve each one on a separate branch and merge to master when they are complete

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Complete 2 [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) challenges, your choice!
  * Or mostly your choice. Complete ones that use JS, not just HTML & CSS
  * Link to the repositories with your finished code & notes in your homework issue

#### Challenge Exercises

* (_Isolate_) Begin [FCC Functional Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/)
* (_Isolate_) Begin [FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/)
* (_Isolate_) Fork [javascript-exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises)
* (_Isolate_) Complete [js-exercises-tdd](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises-tdd)
* (_Isolate_) Keep learning about TDD: [what is TDD?](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+tdd%3F&iax=videos&ia=videos), [online TDD exercises (no NPM troubles :)](http://janke-learning.org/tdd/)

### Project: `practical-javascript`

> [Code-Along](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to study the [`practical-javascript`](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) tutorial from Watch and Code.  It's easily one of the best tutorials out there.

But wait,  Copying Gordon's code is not enough!  You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository called `practical-javascript`, cleanly developed with one branch per version / extra lesson.   After completing the tutorial, there's still two more step:

* Refactor your code from the final version of the project (1 file) into the folder structure you learned in class.
* Write a `development-strategy.md` file to explain the steps Gordon used to develop the project in this tutorial

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README.
